This github public repo summarizes the technical approach to **combine** several <a href="#NewComponents">new</a>
and existing "totally free" **open-source software** 
repos to measure the speed and load capacity risks of high-traffic web and native mobile apps.

   "Totally free" is in quotes because the spirit of free software is that the community which uses them contributes back.
So if you see a typo that needs fixing or an idea that should be considered, please fork this repo,
edit the file, and send us a pull request. Better yet, 
<a href="#NewComponents">join us</a> to revolutionalize the industry.

   The information below is on a public github page rather than a propriatary internal wiki because
   we want to share both the development cost and benefit of the **next generation platform**.
   

<a name="Background">
## Background Why</a>
The approach described here was created in response to the need for a faster, more flexble, and lower cost way to achieve 
<a href="#PerfTesting">"performance testing"</a> (which even commercial vendors have not been able to deliver):

A. **Testing earlier** in the dev. lifecycle through more automatic **generation** of test automation scripts.

   Although various attempts at generating UI code have not taken hold due to complexity,
   generation of APIs is less complex of an undertaking.

B. **Automatic alerts** of slow execution speeds during automated functional testing.

C. **Automatically cycle though variations** of <a href="#configs">
   several configurations</a> during a single manual run initiation.
   More important than hands-free,
   this enables performance analysis to go beyond merely testing to engineering.

The objective here is to **reduce the amount of manual effort** (and human errors) to conducting tests
through automation.

D. **Centralizing data** from various views of system behavior under stress (or not) 
   can be analyzed together will provide the basis for identifying trends and other insights
   using both manual and **"machine learning"** techniques.
   Machine learning would identify more minute issues more comprehensively.

E. Measure how much time it takes to execute various aspects of JavaScript and other work within various browsers.
   This bar chart shows the difference in response time on different browsers (Chrome vs. Firefox) vs. JMeter.
   
<a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/9830052/ed39d31e-58d4-11e5-8ba3-92a536fb1e48.png">
<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/9830052/ed39d31e-58d4-11e5-8ba3-92a536fb1e48.png"></a>

   TODO: Add Microsoft IE and Edge.

JMeter under-reports the total response times experienced by real users because it focuses on the 
**transfer of files** between client and server.


<a name="TypesOfTest">
### Create scripts to impose load using network emulation vs. UI control</a>
There are several ways automation scripts can pretend to be internet browsers and mobile devices:

<a name="FuncTestScript"></a>
  a). By **controlling the UI** of browsers and native apps,
     pretending to be someone typing and moving the mouse around the screen
    (Selenium, Appium, QTP/UFT, TruClient, are in this category).
    
    These make use of passwords unique to each user
    or two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens which users type into UI dialogs.

<a name="NetworkEmulationTestScript"></a>
  b). By **emulating the network traffic** between client and server
    (BadBoy to capture traffic, JMeter, LoadRunner C-scripts, etc. are in this category).
    
      Such interfaces authenticate using OAuth2 hand-shaking which involves one-way signing or
      OAuth1 which involves mutual exchange of public keys.

These two different types of scripting efforts may
use different programming languages and different tools,
and thus by different people in different groups that don't necessarily talk with each other.

   Network traffic emulation scripts can call **API (Application Programming Interfaces)**
   which "headless" programs communicate with each other (with no UI for human users).

It can be time-consuming to create traffic emulation scripts due to the need to "sniff" traffic
in order to convert observed patterns to script code.

Traffic emulation scripts focus on **file transfer time**,
and cannot report time for JavaScript client-rendering,
which grows more over time as more work is being done client-side.

Codification of API calls into standard patterns makes it now possible to 
**generate test script code**.

<a name="OtherIssues">
### Other issues</a>
The description above does not address several aspects:

   * Development tools (Eclipse, etc.) to develop sample apps.
   * Profiling of code (Visual reading JMX, etc.)

   * Public sample custom configurations.
   * Custom configuration storage separate from public repos.
   * Tutorials explaining how to do all of this.

   * Recruitment of others to contribute to this approach
   * Making the economic case

   * Use of clouds (such as AWS EC2, Blazemeter, SauceLabs, Flood.io, etc.).
   * Integration of commercial/licensed tools

   * Management of screen snapshots
   * Localization testing across different browsers

   * Archival / purging / restore of data
   * Construction of test plans (and other services).

The above may be addressed in the sample plan below.

<a name="Gantt">
### Sequence of adoption</a>
The technical relationships described above provide the basis for sequencing the work necessary to adopt the approach.




   Not covered in this are implementation details such as the customized communications, 
   spreadsheets, project plans, and on-site tutorial materials
   which enterprises pay for (thus fund development of this approach).

There has been a lot written on the benefit of contributing to open-source software.

   * http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/69788.html
   * http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/open-source.html

Open-source is especially to enterprises (such as banks, retail, etc.) 
which are not in the business of creating utility software for testing.
The hope of open-sourcing software is that others can maintain the software even when the original author moves on.
And original development of software can receive a level of world-class scrunity, creativity, and velocity.

## Components list</a>
The remainder of this page describes the components mentioned in the [diagram and narrative above](#TheVision).


<a id="app-server"></a>
<a name="AUT">
### Sample Application Under Test (AUT)</a>
The ideal sample app would these characteristics:

   0. Be built on code which provides responsive web, native mobile (iOS and Android), plus APIs.
   0. Be built on code which is open sourced (e.g., available on github).
   0. Be built on code which makes use of open sourced libraries and tools (java).
   0. Be built on code accompanied by tutorials on its construction.
   0. Be built on code which contain coding that returns errors when optionally switched on (for validating test code).
   0. Be built with code which exihibits various approaches (pooling, multi-threading) so that performance can be compared.

Apps currently used for tutorials, benchmarking, and pre-sales do not meet all the criteria above.

   * WebTours used in most JMeter tutorials to date (within commerical performance testing software LoadRunner)
     returns errors based on a switch, but its source is not available to the public.


<a   id="configs"></a>
<a name="configs"></a>
**Configurations** in servers need to be tuned to obtain the most throughput out of hardware.
Examples of configurations include:

   * Maximum virtual memory allocation
   * Maximum threads
   * Maximum queue length
   * Maximum cache size
   * etc.

<a id="Jenkins-CI"></a>
<a name="JenkinsCI"></a>
**Jenkins/CI** 
builds / initiates the various programs listed below on a schedule or when a build is requested.

Selenium and JMeter load generators are "slave nodes" which Jenkins calls to do work.

   Alternatives to Jenkins include https://travis-ci.org/ cloud service which many repos use from github.
   Travis is free for open source, but imposes a fee ($129/month and up) for private use on their cloud.
   
   Jenkins is free to install on premises.

<a id="JMeter-servers">
**JMeter Servers**</a>

<a name="JMeterScripts"></a>
**JMeter scripts**
ramp up load on servers using less test server resources
than Selenium scripts because they do not maintain a copy of the DOM
of each user.

There are different types of performance testing to measure various risks:

   * **Ping tests** measure variability in reaching the server so that spikes in network or server availability will not confound performance test results.
   * **Speed testing** involves single users to identify response times from a range of app functionality.
   * **Concurrency testing** identifies the impact of multiple requests for the same resources at the same time.
   * **Load testing** stops testing at a targeted load level (for certification).
   * **Stress testing** increases users (load) to identify the **bottleneck** limiting further capacity.
   * **Scalability testing** measures how much capacity really improves when additional/less hardware is added/removed.
   * **Endurance testing** measures gradual useage of resources (memory, disk space, etc.) over a longer run times.
   * **Baseline testing** establishes a set of metrics for the tests above as the basis for comparison when configurations are changed.

<a name="CloudEnv"></a>
**Cloud environment.**
Because it usually takes several servers to emulate enough load on an application server under test,
   JMeter is often run within a cloud envrionment such as Amazon.

is a Ruby based DSL for building JMeter test plans


<a name="configs"></a>
**configs** is the set of configuration settings controlling VM memory and other aspects of the server.

<a name="run-variations"></a>
**Run variations** is managed by TAURUS (Test Automation Running Smoothly) was 
written in Java and Python 2.7 to create and edit YAML files that control JMeter slaves
and receive outputs from Blazemeter.

### Analysis of run results</a>

Sending JMeter to the ELK stack means that within JMeter listeners are not needed.
So Kibana would replace what Blazemeter displays.
