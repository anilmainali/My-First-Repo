# Hello World ! 

###This is the first Repo I ever created :) 

First of all, I want to Thank Mr. Wilson Mar for introducing me to Git And GitHub.If he had not introduced me to Git And GitHub than I would not be able to know about GitHub in years to come and for explaining me how  important role it plays to the testers of this modern time where the concepts of DevOps is emerging so knowing how to use Git and  GitHub is  must for any testers, inorder to collaborate with Developers ! As well as, adding one more plus point on the resume inorder to get hired quickly.

I want to keep  this Repo as a memory and want to down jot down all the notes and resourses on How to Get satrted with Git And Github so that anyone new to Git and GitHub can learn the basics.
