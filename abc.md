Here's a command someone types in the Terminal:

```command
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Here's a configuration file. The label on the first line lets you clearly state the file that's being shown or modified:

```nginx
[label /etc/nginx/sites-available/default]
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

    root <^>/usr/share/nginx/html<^>;
    index index.html index.htm;

    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```
